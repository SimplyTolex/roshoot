# Q&A

- Why did you called it `ROSHOOT?`
  - Because I thought it would be funny (especially in the current trend of import substitution). This program actually is not affiliated by anyone, it is just my personal project.
- Does the program supports multiple languages?
  - Not at the moment.
    - ...But will it?
      - Yea, probably. However, it's not a priority.
