# ROSHOOT?

An open-source Python application for holding a quiz or trivia.

---

## Why bother?

The app started as a small project in my bootcamp, but then I decided to try to make a real project from it. The idea of name `ROSHOOT?` is a bit of a meme, maybe I will change it later.

In `ROSHOOT?` you can make a small little quiz and then complete it in the app. For *now*, that's all there is too it, hovewer, I hope I would be able to improve it and make the app more feature-rich.

# Features

- You can come up with your own questions and ask them in the app, using a QuestionFile format.
- *more to come..!*

# FAQ

The FAQ is split up in two sections, the first one, with how-to questions, and the other one with everything else.

## How-to

### How to install?

As of v0.4, the project is just one Python file. You can just download the source code, and run the app with Python installed.

- Download the code using the green `Code` button in the repo --> `Download ZIP`. Then, unzip the archive; 
  - If you are planning on contributing later, you can also [clone the github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Make sure that you have Python installed on your machine;
- Run the `main.py` file.

### How to use?

So, as I've already said, you will need a QuestionFile to start the quiz. You can find how to make these files in [`docs/QuestionFile format.md`](https://github.com/SimplyTolex/roshoot/blob/main/docs/QuestionFile%20format.md) and you can find some examples in [`questions` directory](https://github.com/SimplyTolex/roshoot/tree/main/questions).

### How to communicate?

If you want to ask something, you can do it in the [Discussions](https://github.com/SimplyTolex/roshoot/discussions) tab. I don't really want to create something like a discord server or whatever for the program, that nobody uses, so this should suffice for now.

## Other questions

### What features are planned?

You can [see the roadmap](https://github.com/users/SimplyTolex/projects/1) in the Projects tab.

### Will the program support multiple languages?

It will, but it doesn't right now. I will add this sometime later.

### I found a mistake in this readme / other parts of documentation, what I should do?

You may [open an issue with a `documentation` label](https://github.com/SimplyTolex/roshoot/issues/new?labels=documentation). It will be fixed soon if you point out it to me. English is not my first language, so it can be difficult to me to write these detailed descriptions.

On the other note, you can try to fix it yourself! (there is supposed to be a link but there is nothing currently)

### I have a suggestion, how I do share it?

If you are just throwing an idea out, you can create a discussion in `Ideas` category. Then, one can present the finalised idea in an issue with an `idea` label.
