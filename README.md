# About this branch (`visual-overhaul`)

Here is where a visual overhaul of a program will be made.

It will probably include:

- Cool customisable purple background (because I like purple)
- Colorful buttons with a slight 3D effect (a throwback to original tk buttons)
- New font?

# Changes in the branch so far

- 6/20/2022
  - tried to add "return to title" button, it didn't worked.
  - also separated default ~~meme~~ questions from the code into `questions/default.txt` so they can still be loaded, if necessary.
- 6/27/2022
  - due separating the default questions from the program, now it's impossible to start a quiz without a file (todo line removed)
  - quiz ending line is now using fstrings to reduce clutter in the code

# ROSHOOT?

An open-source Python application for holding a quiz or trivia.

# Q&A

- Why did you called it `ROSHOOT?`
  - Because I thought it would be funny (especially in the current trend of import substitution). This program actually is not affiliated by anyone, it is just my personal project.
- Does the program supports multiple languages?
  - Not at the moment.
    - ...But will it?
      - Yea, probably. However, it's not a priority.
