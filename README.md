# ROSHOOT?

An open-source Python application for holding a quiz or trivia.

---

## Why bother?

The app started as a small project in my bootcamp, but then I decided to try to make a real project from it. The idea of name `ROSHOOT?` is a bit of a meme, maybe I will change it later.

In `ROSHOOT?` you can make a small little quiz and then completing it in the app. For *now*, that's all there is too it, hovewer, I hope I would be able to improve it and make the app more feature-rich.

# Features

- You can come up with your own questions and ask them in the app, using a QuestionFile format.
- *more to come..!*

# FAQ

## How-to

### How to install?

As of v0.4, the project is just one Python file. You can just download the source code, and run the app with Python installed.

- Download the code using the green `Code` button in the repo; 
  - If you are planning on contributing later, you can also [clone the github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- Make sure that you have Python installed on your machine;
- Run the `main.py` file.

### How to use?

So, as I've already said, you will need a QuestionFile to start the quiz. You can find how to make these files in `docs/QuestionFile format.md` and you can find some examples in `questions` directory.

### How to communicate?

If you want to ask something, you can do it in the [Discussions](https://github.com/SimplyTolex/roshoot/discussions) tab. I don't really want to create something like a discord server or whatever for the program, that nobody uses, so this should suffice for now.

## Other questions

### What features are planned?

You can see the roadmap in the Projects tab.

### Will the program support multiple languages?

It will, but it doesn't right now. I will add this sometime later.
